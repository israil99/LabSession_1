    <h1 style="text-align: center"><u>Web Programming : Building Internet Applications</u></h1>
    <p style="text-align: center" > This book is about implementing websites on servers and on browsers.
        Rather than concentrate in <i><b>fine</b></i> detail upon <i><b>specific</b></i> technologies, Chris Bates has provided a <i><b>comprehensive</b></i> and <i><b>accessible</b></i> introduction to the essentials of web development,
        covering an <i><b>ever-expanding</b></i> field in a single volume. Focusing on immediately <i><b>useful</b></i> code rather than theory, this is a how-to book for programmers who need <i><b>quick</b></i> answers.
        Starting with client-side development using HTML and CSS, and moving on to more <i><b>complex</b></i> server-side applications written in open source languages such as Perl and PHP,
        the new edition of this <i><b>successful</b></i> textbook has been substantially revised and updated to include increased coverage of PHP and new sections on data base design and configuration,
        Apache and MySQL. Based on years of <i><b>successful</b></i> teaching and taking an <i><b>insightful</b></i>,
        example-led approach, Web Programming is the complete all-in-one introduction to web site programming and development,
        ideal for classroom use or self-study.</p>
