    <pre>What is Computer Programming?

        Computer programming is the process of writing instructions that get executed by computers.







        The instructions, also known as code, are written in a programming language which the computer can understand and use to perform a task or solve a problem.

        Basic computer programming involves the analysis of a problem and development of a logical sequence of instructions to solve it. There can be numerous paths to a solution and the computer programmer seeks to design and code that which is most efficient. Among the programmer’s tasks are understanding requirements, determining the right programming language to use, designing or architecting the solution, coding, testing, debugging and writing documentation so that the solution can be easily understood by other programmers.







        Computer programming is at the heart of computer science.





        It is the implementation portion of software development, application development and software engineering efforts, transforming ideas and theories into actual, working solutions.
